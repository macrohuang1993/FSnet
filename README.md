Repository for the paper "Light-Field Reconstruction and Depth Estimation from Focal Stack Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks" ICASSP 2020 [[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9053586). 

We use the "ViewNet_train_invC.ipynb" to train the network estimating all-in-focus image from focal stack and use the "DIBR_train_invC.ipynb" for training depth estimation and light field reconstruction networks.
